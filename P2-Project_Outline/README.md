## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For those of us who use ASMR videos to help us sleep, finding the right one can take some time. By the time you do find one, you are too awake to fall asleep, and on goes the cycle of insomnia. My ASMR Playlist will end that cycle. Instead of sifting through thousands of videos, My ASMR will create a playlist of ASMR YouTube videos the user will enjoy which will automatically play on startup. When the user creates an account, the app will ask a few short questions to gather data about the user's preferences. It will use that data to filter through YouTube and select videos to add to the playlist which will automatically play. If a user does not like a particular video, they will simply need to swipe left or right to remove it! 

### Features
This app will include the following features:
1. User registration/login - each user will need to register login information and answer some questions about their preferences. Once registered, the user will need to login everytime he or she needs to log back in. 
2. YouTube search - the app will automatically be loaded with a playlist of videos from YouTube based on the user's preferences.
3. Swipe to delete - if a user does not like a particular video, it can be removed from the playlist by a simple swipe (or press of the button). If the user does not want to delete the video but does not want to watch that particular video at the moment, the user can swipe right to move on to the next video. 
4. User Friendly - this app will look nice and will have user friendly features.
